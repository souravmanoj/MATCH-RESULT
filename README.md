# Project Title: Exploring Machine Learning Method For The Accurate Prediction of Football Matches
Project Overview:

Football is one of the most well-liked and often played sports, thus picking the result of a match presents a fascinating challenge. Making wise judgements to win leagues and tournaments can also be aided by forecasting for clubs and tournament organisers. In the gambling industry, exceptional forecasting accuracy is required because of the significant financial risks involved.Instead of using traditional methods based on quantifiable analysis and artificial intelligence techniques, this study concentrates on machine learning procedures that support extremely accurate outcome prediction. Sports data analysis research and applications, as well as the possibility of using machine learning to predict sports results, are becoming more and more popular. This study investigates the use of ML techniques for predicting football match outcomes across European leagues (Seven cities: England, France, Germany, Italy,Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain), utilizing a comprehensive data pre-processing pipeline that includes handling missing values, normalization, and class imbalance mitigation via ADASYN. The implementation of a stacking classifier—consisting of LR, RFC, and GB as base models, with Logistic Regression as the meta-model—demonstrated substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and performance compared to traditional methods like stacking classifiers The model achieved exceptional results, especially on the Portugal League dataset, with accuracy reaching 95.59% and balanced precision, recall, and F1-score values. Comparative analyses highlighted the superior generalizability and precision of the stacking approach, illustrating its ability to capture complex patterns across diverse datasets and providing a reliable tool for multi-class football outcomes prediction.
